# AA-Budget-Tracker

PWA (Progressive Web Applications)  has changed the playing field, by allowing users to access applications with little to no internet.  Paired with MongoDB which is a popular choice for many apps due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data, accessing information from apps that would otherwise be unavailable without internet connection is now possible.  

This app is gives users a fast and easy way to track their finances.  This app steps things up by allowing users to access their finances any time and anywhere through use of offline capabilities.  The user is able to add exepeneses and depoits to a budget tracker with or without a connecton.  If the user enters transactions offline, the totla will be updated when they are brought back online.
