# AA(Anytime, Anywhere)-Budget-Tracker

PWA (Progressive Web Applications) has changed the playing field, by allowing users to access applications with little to no internet.  Paired with MongoDB which is a popular choice for many apps due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data, accessing information from apps that would otherwise be unavailable without internet connection is now possible.  

This app gives users a fast and easy way to track their finances.  This app steps things up by allowing users to access their finances anytime and anywhere through use of offline capabilities.  The user is able to add expenses and deposits to a budget tracker with or without a connection.  If the user enters transactions offline, the total will be updated when they are brought back online.   


## User Story

AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 



## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
